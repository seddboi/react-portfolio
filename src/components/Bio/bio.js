            <p>Hi, </p>
            <p>I am a recent University of California: Riverside Graduate with a degree in Applied Mathematics, 
                and am looking to further explore my strengths as a learner and as an achiever. Despite having a background in Mathematics, 
                I have spent countless hours building my strengths in developing my own web based applications! 
                With my urge to provide quality applications and my drive to work a fast paced environment and meet deadlines, I am sure to
                be a great fit in any position I am placed in! </p>
        </div>
